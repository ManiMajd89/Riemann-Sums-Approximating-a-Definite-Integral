# Riemann Sums: Approximating a Definite Integral

This MATLAB project demonstrates the use of Riemann sums to approximate the integral of a function. It computes the left and right Riemann sums for increasing numbers of subintervals and compares them with the analytical solution.

## Features

- Computes the left and right Riemann sums for a given function.
- Evaluates Riemann sums across a range of subinterval values.
- Compares the numerical approximations to the analytical solution.
- Visualizes the results with a clear and informative plot.

## Problem Definition

We approximate the definite integral of a function using:
- **Left Riemann Sum**: Function height evaluated at the left edge of subintervals.
- **Right Riemann Sum**: Function height evaluated at the right edge of subintervals.

The approximation improves as the number of subintervals (`n`) increases.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/riemann-sums.git

2.	Open riemann_sums.m in MATLAB.

3.	Run the script to compute and visualize the Riemann sums.

## Visualization

The plot generated by the script shows:

- Red Dashed Line: Right Riemann sum values.

- Blue Solid Line: Left Riemann sum values.

- Green Line: Analytical solution for comparison.
